Copy (or symlink) the plugins to ~/.cpanm/plugins

TODO/Ideas:
* fix cp562an to actually query the distribution (parse 02packages?)
* backpan - get a specific version from BackPAN
* nearest_mirror - automatically pick the nearest mirror (and cache it)
* test_reporter - report test success/failures
* local_lib - Something to do with local::lib. Maybe auto-setup?
* dzil - Uses dzil to test and install modules
* growl - Growl install success/failures
* github - allows you to say cpanm github:miyagawa/Plack
