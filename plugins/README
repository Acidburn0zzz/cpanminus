Copy (or symlink) the plugins to ~/.cpanm/plugins

TODO/Ideas:
* fix cp562an to actually query the distribution (parse 02packages?)
* gitpan/backpan - get a specific version from BackPAN or GitPAN
* nearest_mirror - automatically pick the nearest mirror (and cache it)
* dzil - build from git checkout that has dzil.ini (but no Makefile.PL/Build.PL)
* test_reporter - report test success/failures
* local_lib - Something to do with local::lib. Maybe auto-setup?
